# About

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) provides a content infrastructure for digital teams to power content in websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.

The Contentful Discovery web app gives you a quick and easy way to preview your content on a web environment, and explore the contents of your Spaces.

You can try out the app at https://discovery.contentful.com/ or you can check out the source code and suggest your own improvements.
